|--- | --- | --- |
| What is it? | A decentralized distributed ledger that is shared, replicated, and synchronized among the members of a network and used for digital assets, e.g. deeds and identity credentials (licenses, birth certificates, etc…).  The list grows as more becomes digital. | A cryptocurrency. |
| Is it slow? | Depending on the setup, millions, billions, or more transactions per second are possible. | It takes about 10 minutes to confirm one transaction. |
| Do only bad guys use it? | Policy can determine whether users are known or anonymous. | Users are anonymous. |
| Is it just used to fund illicit activities? | Blockchain can be used in conjunction with smart contracts to support identity, property management, data storage, voting, automation of contracts, financial services, and much, much more. | Bitcoin is used for monetary transactions.  Its system does not incorporate smart contracts. |
| What else can it do? | Blockhain has added functionality to talk across databases (interoperate and information share).  It can also incorporate sensors (e.g. track the temperature of food in a supply chain). | Bitcoin is used for monetary transactions. | 
| Is everyone allowed to become a user? | A blockchain can be completely open or specific users can be invited to join. | Anyone can join.|
| Is there any way to control what happens on the system? | The ability for a user to read, verify, and/or write can be restricted. | Anyone can read, verify, and write. |
| Is it secure? | Blockchain itself has not been breached.  Poor implementation can cause issues, however.  Planning for crypto-agility (ability to replace cyphers and keep the underlying program) will help with future-proofing. | Bitcoin exchanges and wallets have been breached. |
| What’s the consensus mechanism? | It varies: could be based on lottery-based algorithms (e.g. proof of work or proof of elapsed time), voting-based methods (e.g. simplified byzantine fault tolerance), or something else. | Proof of work, which uses a lot of computational energy. |
| Is it proven by global leaders? | Fortune 500 companies have been using blockchain for a few years now (testing, scaling, etc.) | While Bitcoin has been around since 2009, Fortune 500 companies have not been adopting its usage. |
