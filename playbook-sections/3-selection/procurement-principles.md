# Leverage commercial contracting methods  
Leverage the efficiency of commercial contracting methods. If and when possible, use services and tools sold by private sector vendors. Blockchain was not created by the Government and only for Government purposes, so Government shouldn't buy blockchain the same way it buys tanks.  
# Buy small, build small, test, and iterate  
Set up each contract for a quick win, then determine how to scale that success or pivot quickly. Well-interntioned program offices frequently default to creating large-scale, software development contracts. However, these procurements often take years before work begins (if the procurement isn't cancelled due to protests). In addition, larger contracts often lead to more bureaucracy - increased cumbersome documentation, more approvals - all of which slow down the delivery of working blockchain products. Instead, adopt modular contracting methods, such as awarding a small contract for the development of a blockchain Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The time to award will be faster, the procurement risk lower, and the agency will show a quick win with a deployed working product within 12 months of award. As the agency is involved with the building a wor___. Building an MVP will also play a significant role in the agency's adoption of Blockchain, helping to pave the way for future Blockchain adoption. After the MVP is developed, the agency can pivot or procure additional services to further develop features for the blockchain product.
