- What does the success look like?

- Explaining Basic Principle of Assessment at a high-level
  - Federal Drivers: Overview of key federal drivers the assessment framework will need to address. Examples could be the FITARA framework that focuses on IT enterprise, OMB drivers, etc. Allowing CIOs to have an assessment framework that directly identifies issues that blockchain can solve
- Providing links to libraries, self-guided learning tools, concepts etc.
  - Links: Create a library landing page that is updated regularly with the latest guidance (Jim has volunteered to update; need to work out details with ACT-IAC on opportunity; possibly coordinate with Justin at GSA if needed)
- Enable people to have reference to the broader knowledge base
  - Permissionless Blockchain
  - Public Permissioned Blockchain
  - Private Permissioned Blockchain

## Best Practices (3-5 pages)

- Set of practical advice around blockchain assessment
- Focus on 5-10 key practices
- Map each best practice with links or references to:
  - Use Case from GSA github library (Justin's Atlas - https://github.com/GSA/emerging-technology-atlas)
  - Recommended Appropriate Taxonomy
- Each best practice should have similar format
  - Header with high-level tagline/naming of the practice
  - Three key elements: description, analysis, takeaway/outcome

## Outcomes (0.5 – 1 page)

- Clearly define few deliverables/outcomes of the assessment
- How outcomes from assessment link to next phase - readiness
