# Outline

## Introduction (1-2 pages)

- Overall purpose (State Why?)
- Goals
- Audience
- Method (How? – guided, practical, blockchain specific)
- What does the success look like?

## Assessment Overview (1 page)

- Explaining Basic Principle of Assessment at a high-level
  - Federal Drivers: Overview of key federal drivers the assessment framework will need to address. Examples could be the FITARA framework that focuses on IT enterprise, OMB drivers, etc. Allowing CIOs to have an assessment framework that directly identifies issues that blockchain can solve
- Providing links to libraries, self-guided learning tools, concepts etc.
  - Links: Create a library landing page that is updated regularly with the latest guidance (Jim has volunteered to update; need to work out details with ACT-IAC on opportunity; possibly coordinate with Justin at GSA if needed)
- Enable people to have reference to the broader knowledge base
  - Permissionless Blockchain
  - Public Permissioned Blockchain
  - Private Permissioned Blockchain
  - Graphic Suggestions: Visually demonstrate an evaluation methodology with a set of pro/con criteria/features for each option. Could be a table with columns and rows that as an option meets a criterion/feature, the individual uses a check-mark

## Best Practices (3-5 pages)

- Set of practical advice around blockchain assessment
  - Include regulatory considerations/mandates
  - Provide guidance on approval for implementation of a prototype
  - Emphasize ROI to common benefits to the network as a whole, the individuals members, etc (design thinking based on personas and a prioritization matrix around value vs. complexity should be included) and specific to government, not just about dollars but efficiencies (include relevance to MGT Act)
    - Proof of Concept vs. Proof of Technology
    - Trust among CIOs (networks between agencies that exchange data/asset and/or information)
  - Create List of Questions to Consider (needs research by all). Suggestions below:
    - What makes a great use case for blockchain for the business network? That it provides value to the business network (not just for one business network member) through one or more of the following: 
      - Consensus; all parties agree to network verified transactions. 
Provenance; enable any asset to be secured to a Blockchain ledger, physical or virtual. 
Immutability; once data has been written no one, not even a system administrator, can change it.
      - Finality; once an operation is completed, that operation is completed for good.
Privacy & permissioned; ensure appropriate visibility; transactions are secure, authenticated & verifiable.
      - Controlled access & transformation; smart agreements on how to use the data embedded in transaction database & executed with transactions.
    - Resulting in:
      - Removing Friction
      - Getting rid of the “middle man”
      - Leveraging an Existing Business Network but not a Closed Network
      - Valuing Transparency and History of a Shared Ledger to all participants
      - Adding the Citizen/Customer to the value chain
- Focus on 5-10 key practices
- Map each best practice with links or references to:
  - Use Case from GSA github library (Justin's Atlas - https://github.com/GSA/emerging-technology-atlas)
  - Recommended Appropriate Taxonomy
  - Each best practice should have similar format
    - Header with high-level tagline/naming of the practice
    - Three key elements: description, analysis, takeaway/outcome

## Outcomes (0.5 – 1 page)

- Clearly define few deliverables/outcomes of the assessment
- How outcomes from assessment link to next phase - readiness
