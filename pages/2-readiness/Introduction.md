Purpose:
As mentioned in the introduction, the purpose of the readiness phase is to prepare the enterprises and organization for the blockchain effort and define the required capabilities. The generic structure of the blockchain readiness phase is similar to that of any other emerging technology readiness guideline or strategy framework such as M3 but there are nuances specific to Blockchain that should be understood, undertaken and considered before calling an organization ready for a blockchain initiative. The purpose of this section is to  highlight these nuances in the context of a generic framework like M3, which are well understood by the industry. 

Key Goals:
To prepare the government agencies and organizations for blockchain effort and define the required capabilities, readiness phase should aim to meet the following goals to increase the likelihood of success of the following program:

A.	Stand-up Blockchain governance office
B.	Define scope of blockchain services and governance processes
C.	Assess risks and establish risk mitigation processes
D.	Assess existing system's integration readiness
E.	Assess selected KPIs evaluation readiness

Key Participants:
Apart from the “assessment” phase participants, the key participants in blockchain readiness phase include blockchain subject matter experts, who may or may not be from the agency initiating the program, subject matter experts from lines of business and systems with which the proposed blockchain is supposed to integrate and a blockchain enterprise architect who has the responsibility of creating the governance framework and leading the capability definition exercises.

Approach Guidance:
In most cases, assessment phase will precede readiness to ensure the use case selection and business relevance has been determined. In other cases, government agencies may actually have assessment and readiness phases running in parallel. This is specially true when an agency has already completed a PoC and a larger project is being planned or when the respective agency is integrating as a participant or a user with an external agency which has already implemented the distributed ledger.  

The following graphic details the key activities, inputs, enablers and outcomes an that are advised to ensure the completeness of the readiness phase:

Expected Outcomes:
The two-pronged strategy to prepare the agencies for blockchain efforts as well as define key capabilities should result in the outcomes depicted in the graphic above. At the end of this phase, the agency should be able to answer the following questions:
1.	Who are the key participants in the proposed blockchain initiative?
2.	How will the security be managed for the key participants?
3.	How will the onboarding/separation happen for members?
4.	In case of cross-agency collaborations and open-source consortiums, who will be responsible for managing the changes?
5.	What are the key technological, business context, security, performance, user experience, program management and governance related risks specific to the proposed DLT solution?
6.	What is the proposed governance and management structure?
7.	Who, what and how will they be impacted by the proposed solution? What is the strategy to manage the change?
8.	Are the KPIs defined and baselined?
9.	Does the initial schedule and estimated cost allow for agile product development where the time and cost can be recalibrated based on on-going learnings?
10.	What is the procurement strategy for the proposed program?
11.	What are the key business capabilities of the proposed system?
