- How to get the reader ready to move forward with blockchain
- Show where the pitfalls are

## USG Scope

- Federal U.S. Government

## Target Audience

- Someone who is more of a worker bee who is interested in blockchain and how they might use it with their immediate work
- Someone who is a PM who is looking to use blockchain maybe in an internal system or as a full-fledged project

## Possible Content Strategy

- Decision gates to help the reader figure out what to do with blockchain
- Have a methodology/process section (what activities/methodology one should follow to get blockchain up and running)
- Consider section "chiefs" who would have merge/commit authority
- Lead playbook with some basic questions that helps the reader navigate the document
- Some of the steps can leverage other existing blockchain efforts
