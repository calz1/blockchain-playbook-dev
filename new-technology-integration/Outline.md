CAL ZEMELMAN:
1.	Machine Learning - a subfield of artificial intelligence that deals with training computers to spot patterns and create predictive models for the future. Within machine learning, there are the ideas of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. All of these might be useful for data within a blockchain, though the most obvious one is supervised learning. Imagine your blockchain stores financial transactions and whether they were found to be fraudulent. You could use a supervised learning technique on data from the blockchain to build a model for detecting fraudulent transactions.
2.	RPA - robotic process automation is the idea of using technology to have a program perform tasks that were previously done by a person. Imagine you have a legacy procurement system where purchase orders must be keyed in to a terminal application. You've also implemented a blockchain that stores procurement actions around your agency. You could create an RPA solution that read approved actions from the blockchain and automatically keyed them into the procurement system, reducing labor and increasing the accuracy of those POs.
3.	Big Data Management (including data storage) - big data can mean many things but the classic idea  is that new factors like data volume, velocity, and variability have proved difficult for traditional data processing solutions to handle and required new technology like Hadoop and Spark. While blockchain is great for certain use cases, it is not a great solution for high data volumes or complex analytical queries. If you need to do deep analysis on your transactions, you may want to look into doing that with a big data solution. If you need to handle more than a couple transactions per second or more than 100GB of data, you may want to pivot from exploring blockchain to a big data solution.
4.	Master Data Management (MDM) - a systematic way of handling important reference data for an organization that must be consistent. For example, if an organization does not have an standardized way of labeling customers but wants to do cross-cutting measures of customer service, they have a problem with MDM. If multiple parties or systems are participating in a blockchain, you must have good MDM in place or you will not be able to extract high quality information from your data.
