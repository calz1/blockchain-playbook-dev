VENKAT KODUMUDI:
5.	Cyber Security
    The term Cyber Security is used to collectively address the controls described in and provided by the NIST 800.3, and FIPS 199 directives that govern Federal Government Systems and OWASP standards for commercial sector. Cyber Security intersects with a Blockchain solution in a couple of areas:
    1. Design and Development of the solution should ensure secure practices are built into the solution, not just to ensure compliance to the standards, but also to ensure the solution is free from hacking, and other unsecure practices.
    2. Ensure compliance to the controls governed by the directives.

6.	Archiving
    As the number of blocks in the blockchain increases, the finite storage resources become dear to the success of the implementation. Archiving is one way to ensure enough storage is available for the operations of the system by moving a subset of data based on certain rules into an offline / somewhat difficult to access storage (also sometimes referred to as 'offline' storage). Archiving can get very complicated depending on the requirements. There can be tiers of archiving, such as semi-instantaneous access, and completely offline.
Archiving is a prominent concept, if designed or implemented incorrectly can break a solution. It is espcially acute with Blockchain as the entire premise of Blockchain is based on the fact that 'a blockchain' holds the single source of truth of everything that happened.

7.	Smart Contract (??)
    Please refer to the selection secion of the playbook for a definition of Smart Contract

8.	Messaging Protocols 
    Messaging is used as a mechanism to transfer and transport data between systems that perform specific functions. The systems can be anywhere from entire applications to a small microservice that perform a specific function. Most of these systems can't operate in a silo and need to interact with other systems either to get data from or to give data to. In some cases, the messaging is as simple as just transferring data from one location to another, while in other cases complex transformation is performed to map the data to suite the destination system. Some example of messaging protocols are Web Services, REST services, RPC etc. There are many messaging platforms such as Dell Bhoomi, Mulesoft, Rabbit MQ, IBM MQ Series, Apache Kafka etc.
    
The importance of messaging in a Blockchain environment is multi fold.
    1. Intra network participant communication
    2. Inter network communication
    3. Communication between the blockchain and the participants
