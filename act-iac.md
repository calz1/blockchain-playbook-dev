## American Council for Technology-Industry Advisory Council (ACT-IAC)

The American Council for Technology (ACT) is a non-profit educational organization established to create a more effective and innovative government.  ACT-IAC provides a unique, objective, and trusted forum where government and industry executives are working together to improve public services and agency operations through the use of technology.  ACT-IAC contributes to better communications between government and industry, collaborative and innovative problem solving, and a more professional and qualified workforce.
The information, conclusions, and recommendations contained in this publication were produced by volunteers from government and industry who share the ACT-IAC vision of a more effective and innovative government.  ACT-IAC volunteers represent a wide diversity of organizations (public and private) and functions.  These volunteers use the ACT-IAC collaborative process, refined over thirty years of experience, to produce outcomes that are consensus-based.  The findings and recommendations contained in this report are based on consensus and do not represent the views of any particular individual or organization.

To maintain the objectivity and integrity of its collaborative process, ACT-IAC does not accept government funding.
ACT-IAC welcomes the participation of all public and private organizations committed to improving the delivery of public services through the effective and efficient use of IT. For additional information, visit the ACT-IAC website at www.actiac.org.

## Emerging Technology Community of Interest

ACT-IAC, through the Emerging Technology Community of Interest, formed a Blockchain Working Group to give voice to and provide an authoritative resource for government agencies looking to understand and incorporate blockchain technology and functionality into their organizations.  This working group includes government and industry thought leaders incubating government blockchain use cases.  The ACT-IAC Emerging Technology Community of Interest (ET COI) mission is to provide an energetic, collaborative consortium comprised of leading practitioners in data science, technology, and research, engaged with industry, academia, and public officials and executives focused on emerging and leading technologies which transform public sector capabilities.
